The questions are simple. The answers, not so.

I'm a newbie too, but I think it is just a ""warning"". 
:)  I suspect it is just to tell you that you are
appending to a file and not creating a new file.  Iwas
a bit upset the first time I saw it until I realised
the write command was working just fine.

I suspect that you would have to join the two matrices
together in R.

New Revision: 22973

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=22973

Log:
Apparently, 3.0.25 broke smb4k badly ;-)
smb4k uses 'net rap server domain' to list servers in domain.
Previously we just ignored all arguments in net_rap_server() but now we don't
as 'net rap server name' has added an explicit check on arguments.

Allow 'net rap server domain' to aid smb4k. Any other arguments will cause help message.

root privleges or not, 'better' practice mandates against 
building as root to avoid inadvertent pollution of one's 
permanent environment;  non-root building is the only sensible 
way to go, short of a full blown chrooted building 
environment (I do not dislike such chrooted build 
environments at all, but they are harder to get going, and 
may constitute overkill for your needs as you stated them).

Ask if you get stuck  ;)

You can purchase the version from voxin for around $5.00 which works on 
either debian or ubuntu.  They also include the necessary c++ runtime 
library.  
Why is Janina charging so much?

0,Re: [R] A question about logical controls and function arguements,"jim holtman <jholtman@gmail.com>, r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch",Jason Q McClintic <jqmcclintic@stthomas.edu>,"Sir,

I freely admit my ignorance as to the subtleties of specifying arguments.

Let me make sure I understand your suggestion: create a variable filter
which takes 1 or 0 (filter or not) and another called, say,
filter.location which is the ordered triplet.

It does add to the number of options, but would seem to simplify the
underlying code. It appears I may have attempted to code above my skill
level.

Thanks for the assistance,

Jason Q McClintic

1,Pictures,smiles@flax9.uwaterloo.ca,"""Karla Meyers"" <a-47@adamcabe.com>",Hello! I am bored tonight. I am nice girl that would like to chat with you. Email me at xml@docmaildirect.info only. Will send some of my pictures
0,"[R] shoudl I use apply, sapply, etc instead of a ""for loop""?",r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch,Thomas Pujol <thomas.pujol@yahoo.com>,"I have been trying to learn the various ""apply"" functions but am still learning their appropriate use.  I appreciate any help the R community can offer me.  Sorry for the length of this post.

Background:

I have data on my hard drive organized in the following manner:

The data pertains to many different ""samples"" of data. (e.g. sample 001, sample, 002, sample 003, etc.)

Each ""sample"" contains many different ""data frames"" for a large number of different data-items. 
(e.g. sat score, median income of zip-code, gender, GPA, etc)

The data frames and files are each named with the data-item name as the ""prefix"" of the name and the ""sample number"" as the suffix of the name.
e.g. sat.001, income.001, sat.002, income.002

Each data frame has approximately 5,000 rows, 1 for each ""person"".

Note: The files are somehat large, and most of my analysis will be completed within each ""sample"" .  (Thus, I think that I should probably keep the files stored as separate files, and not combine them into a larger list or data frames. I also do not think I want to load all the files for multiple samples at once, as this mayy take up too much memory.)  Also, I have similar simplified description of the files; many contain multiple columns of data.


###############
I have written a ""for"" loop that does the following:

a. For each ""sample period"" I load two files.
b. I perform a function on the data contain din these two files.
c. I take the results and save them as a new file.
I proceed to the next sample.

Is there a ""better"" (i.e. more elegant and/or efficient) way to do this, perhaps with one of the ""apply"" functions? (e.g. apply, sapply, lapply, tapply?)

#e.g. my simplified code

#this creates example data:
sat.001=c(500,400,750)
sat.002=c(245,455,767)

income.001=c(5020,4200,7250)
income.002=c(2425,4525,7627)

filenames=c('sat.001', 'sat.002', 'income.001', 'income.002')
sapply(filenames,function(x) { save( list=x , file = paste(x ,'.r', sep ='')  ) })
rm(sat.001,sat.002,income.001,income.002,filenames)
ls() #
##############
#my for loop

divide = function(x,y) {x/y} 
#creates a custom function


#inputs to my loop:
samplenames=c('001','002')
x.name='sat'
y.name='income'
fun='divide'

for (i in 1:length(samplenames) ) {

x.name.suf = paste(x.name,samplenames[i],sep='.') 
#name of x file on hrd drive

y.name.suf = paste(y.name,samplenames[i],sep='.') 
#name of y file on hrd drive

x=get(load(file = paste(x.name.suf ,'r', sep ='.')  , envir = .GlobalEnv) ) 
#loads and gets the x file

y=get(load(file = paste(y.name.suf ,'r', sep ='.')  , envir = .GlobalEnv) ) 
#loads and gets the y file

temp=get(fun)(x,y) 
#applies custom function specified in arguments above
# to data  contained in x and y files

save( list='temp' , file = paste(fun,x.name ,y.name,samplenames[i],sep='.') ) 
#save the results in files with name that specifies 
#name of function, name of x, name of y, and sample number
#files will be used for later analysis

rm(list=paste(x.name.suf , sep ='.'))
rm(list=paste(y.name.suf , sep ='.'))
rm(x.name.suf,y.name.suf,x,y,temp)
}

rm(divide,samplenames,x.name,y.name,fun,i)
ls()

Word of the Day for Monday, May 28, 2007

enunciate \ee-NUN-see-ayt; ih-\, transitive verb:

1. To utter articulately; to pronounce.
2. To state or set forth precisely or systematically.
3. To announce; to proclaim; to declare.
4. To utter words or syllables articulately.

 And all agree that he was from his college days a wonderful
 speaker, one who enunciated clearly and crisply and never seemed
 to have to grope for a word. 
 -- Louis Auchincloss, Woodrow Wilson John Maynard Keynes, a famous economist and outstandingly
 successful investor, enunciated the theory most lucidly in 1936. 
 -- Burton G. Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street His concern about America's incipient drift out of manufacturing
 was widely challenged by many feel-good commentators, who
 proceeded to enunciate the now widely accepted doctrine that a
 shift to postindustrialism would boost U.S. income growth. 
 -- Eamonn Fingleton, In Praise of Hard Industries This is such an obvious, commonsensical truism that it seems
 almost foolish to enunciate it. 
 -- Seymour Martin Lipset, American Exceptionalism -------------------------------------------------------------------

Enunciate comes from Latin enuntiare, ""to tell; to disclose; to
declare; to pronounce clearly,"" from e- + nuntiare, ""to announce,""
from nuntius, ""a messenger.""

Maybe your task would be easier if you used DBI and DBD::CSV and use 
SQL to group the data the way you need them instead of loading the 
raw data and ""hand-processing"" them.

This has been discussed on the list before (if I remember correctly), and I
have been meaning to add something to the latticeExtra package.  An
implementation would look something like this (beware of line wrapping):


useOuterStrips  2) How do I control the text of the strips so that for instance

Generally speaking, you need to write your own strip function.  The
default (strip.default) has some useful arguments that modify its
behaviour, and in particular 'factor.levels' might do what you
want.  If you are going to do this in conjunction with (1), life will
actually be simpler and you can get away with using strip.custom():


useOuterStrips(xyplot(y ~ x | g1 + g2, groups=g3, data=DF),
               strip =
               strip.custom(factor.levels =
                            expression(g[1]==alpha, g[1]==beta)),
               strip.left =
               strip.custom(horizontal = FALSE,
                            factor.levels =
                            expression(g[2]==gamma, g[2]==delta)))


Otherwise, you will really have to write a proper strip function that
calls strip.default() with different values of 'factor.levels'
depending on the value of 'which.given'.

Note also the 'strip.names' and 'sep' argument of strip.default(),
which might be more in line with what you want to do.

0,"Re: A computer issue, how should I deal with this? Best solution?","""Speakup is a screen review system for Linux."" <speakup@braille.uwo.ca>","""Spie Sutherland"" <spie@proficio.ca>","I would suggest a dual boot configuration like this:

Create a windows ntfs partition for winxp.
Create a windows fat32 partition for data.
Create a linux ext3 partition for linux root filesystem
Create one or more linux ext3 partitions for linux data
Create a linux swap partition.

Never store anything you want to save in the winxp
or linux root partitions. This way if you ever need to
reinstall either you leave your data partitions alone 
and never lose anything important.

The windows fat32 data partition can be mounted in
linux so you can move files to and from windows. 
Note that ntfs is read only in linux so best to use fat32
for this partition.

Make one of the linux data partitions the /home mount.
I usually make a small partition for /home but a large 
one, actually several, for data. I also usually create a 
separate /usr/local partition for software I compile from
source to add to the original distro, but that's not really
necessary. The reason I do it is so its easy to save stuff
that might have taken a while to figure out when adding
extra software.

For the bootloader config, set winxp to be the default 
boot, linux as the second choice. If you use a timeout 
then it will automatically start winxp for your father. 
If you don't want to use timeout, just tell him to pick 
winxp from the boot menu always.

There is also the possibility of using vmware but I am 
finding that vmware is getting to be a performance 
problem lately, at least with the new free versions. 
Best to have a dual boot into native os and then you 
can still add some vmware on either or both winxp
or linux in addition to the dual boot.

I used to have a laptop setup that could dual boot into
native win2k or linux, but could also run linux inside 
vmware on win2k, that was really nice. It used the 
vmware workstation 5, which seemed to be much 
better than the free vmware server that they give away.

Another suggestion: create a rescue partition, and set
up a small linux system with speech enabled, add this
to your boot menu. If you ever have problems with 
the other bootables, you can boot into that and then
mount other drives to make any necessary changes. 
If you boot into the rescue partition you can chroot
into the regular linux root filesystem if its not booting.

I don't use that package or the functions, but it looks like from your
example above, that you might be able to create a modified barplot()
function and then call that in subplot().

	liblicense/trunk",Jon Phillips <jon@rejon.org>,Jason Kivlighn <jkivlighn@gmail.com>,"1) xdg-mime is command-line only, making it a run-time dependency, which
I don't like.  If xdg-mime doesn't exist, we have to give up on
embedding because we won't know what i/o module to use. 2) xdgmime is in
cvs, so no svn:externals.

For a 100kb library, with relatively few updates (cvs shows some updates
3/4 weeks ago, and the updates before that were 12+ months ago), I think
it's worth it to remove the trouble of an external dependency, and
spawning xdg-mime and parsing it's output.

Well, it must be seen *if* upstream actually have the right to license
them under the GNU GPL...

It depends on what you mean by ""remake"".

If the ""remake"" is an independent reimplementation of the basic idea of
another game (similar game mechanics, similar rules, similar game goals,
and the like), then I think the ""remake"" is entirely copyrighted by its
author(s): no problems here.

If the ""remake"" copies copyrighted elements from the other game
(characters, story/plot, dialogs, or, worse, graphics/sounds), then I
think the ""remake"" is actually a derivative work of the original game
and its author(s) need(s) permission from the original game copyright
holder(s) in order to license the ""remake"" in some way or another.

The usual disclaimer: IANAL, corrections from more knowledgeable people
always welcome.

Parrot is open source today, not *mumble* down the road like the JVM will be.

Parrot supports more dynamic features than only ""find method by name at 
runtime"".

Parrot doesn't have (obvious) patent issues.

I have commit access.

Okay, that last one isn't a serious reason either way,

Word of the Day for Wednesday, June 13, 2007

contravene \kon-truh-VEEN\, transitive verb:

1. To act or be counter to; to violate.
2. To oppose in argument; to contradict.

 In 1620 most people considered the likelihood of reversing the
 seasons inside a building impossible, and many deemed it
 sacrilege, an attempt to contravene the natural order, to twist
 the configuration of the world established by God. 
 -- Tom Shachtman, Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold Anorexics, for example, clearly contravene our evolutionary
 dictate to eat. 
 -- Jerry A. Coyne, ""Of Vice and Men"", The New Republic, April 3,
 2000 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Contravene comes from Late Latin contravenire, ""to oppose,"" from
Latin contra-, ""against"" + venire, ""to come.""

   ""Giovanni Parrinello"" <parrinel@med.unibs.it>","""Sicotte, Hugues   Ph.D."" <Sicotte.Hugues@mayo.edu>","People, don't get angry at the pharma statistician, he is just trying to
abide by an FDA requirement that is designed to insure that test perform
reliably the same. There is no point in getting into which product is
better. As far as the FDA rules are concerned a validated system beats a
""better"" system any day of the week.

Here is your polite answer.
You can develop and try your software in R.
Should they need to use those results in a report that will matter to
the FDA, then you can work together with him to set up a validated
environment for S-plus. You then have to commit to port your code to
S-plus.

As I assume that you do not work in a regulated environment, you
probably wouldn't have access to a validated SAS environment anyways. It
is not usually enough to install a piece of software, you have to
validate every step of the installation. Since AFAIK the FDA uses
S-plus, it would be to your pharma person's advantage to speed-up
submissions if they also had a validated S-plus environment.

I like to know the answer as well.
To be honest, I really have hard time to understand the mentality of
clinical trial guys and rather believe it is something related to job
security.

0,[R] Percentage area of a distribution,R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch,"""Alan Gibson"" <alan.gibson@gmail.com>","It seems like this should be pretty straight forward, but for some
reason the answer escapes me.

I have a normal distribution S made up of two normal distributions C
and C-bar. I need to find the percentage of the area of S that both C

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Software_projects#Guido_van_Robot_.28educational_programming_language.29

An important part of this program are the lessons, exercises and help files.
I was wondering if there's a ""preferred"" way of displaying such files,
I mean is there some
sort of central ""helpviewer"" app or should each activity provide their
own viewer?

BTW, the files are available in any format.

Thanks,

6:59 PM, 6/17/07, Update: Spacewalk ends; all major objectives accomplished=
 (UPDATED at 10:20 PM with flight director wrapup)

Astronauts Pat Forrester and Steve Swanson put the finishing touches on a d=
ramatic space station assembly mission today, completing a fourth and final=
 spacewalk to activate a new solar array rotation mechanism and ready the l=
ab complex for a critical sequence of upcoming construction flights.

""I couldn't be more pleased,"" said lead space station Flight Director Kelly=
 Beck. ""The complexity of the tasks that we had was a challenge and the cre=
w just executed perfectly. But then to throw in the Russian segment compute=
r problems we had and still come out of this mission with everything done t=
hat we planned to have done is just a real success and we're very proud of =
it.""

Today's spacewalk began at 12:25 p.m. and ended with the start of airlock r=
epressurization at 6:54 p.m. This was the fourth and final spacewalk for th=
e Atlantis astronauts, pushing the crew's total to 27 hours and 58 minutes.=
 Forrester and Swanson logged a total of 13 hours and 45 minutes for the se=
cond and fourth EVAs while Reilly and Danny Olivas put in 14 hours and 13 m=
inutes during the first and third outings.

Overall, this was the 87th spacewalk devoted to space station assembly and =
maintenance since construction began in 1998. With today 's EVA, 48 U.S. as=
tronauts, 15 Russian cosmonauts, two Canadians and four astronauts represen=
ting Japan, Germany, France and Sweden have logged 537 hours and three minu=
tes of EVA time building and maintaining the space station.

""It's time for you to come on in,"" astronaut Jim Reilly radioed from Atlant=
is' flight deck as the spacewalkers wound up a long day.

""I'll take one last look and if I could, just say happy Father's Day,"" Forr=
ester replied. ""It's been a great way to spend it. I want to say happy Fath=
er's Day to my Dad, my father-in-law and for being a father to my two sons.=
 So thanks.""

""I'd like to echo the same words,"" Swanson called. ""Thanks for reminding me=
.""

""Absolutely,"" Reilly said, ""a lot of fathers on this flight and we're all e=
njoying a great Father's Day.""

The primary goal of today's spacewalk was an inspection of the drive motors=
 on the starboard solar alpha rotary joint - SARJ - on the right side of th=
e station's main solar power truss; removal of a final few launch locks to =
permit free rotation; stowage of a keel pin used to anchor the S3/24 truss =
element in the shuttle's cargo bay during launch; and installation of a saf=
ety stop on the end of the track used by the station's robot arm-carrying m=
obile transporter.

The spacewalkers also ran a computer cable that eventually will permit astr=
onauts in the U.S. segment of the station to command systems in the Russian=
 segment. They opened a newly installed hydrogen valve that is part of a ne=
w U.S. oxygen generation system and attempted to bolt down a micrometeoroid=
 debris shield that could not be put back in place during an earlier spacew=
alk. Swanson and Forrester were not able to get it anchored, either, so the=
y used tethers to lash it down.

""They completed the remainder of the tasks that we were hoping to accomplis=
h on this mission,"" Beck said. ""They finished preparing the solar alpha rot=
ary joint, so now it is released and free to move. They also cleared the tr=
anslation path to work site one, which is the new (robot arm) work site tha=
t came up on this truss.

""They also opened the oxygen generator system vent valve, that's a valve th=
at Jim Reilly actually installed on the third spacewalk. The configuration =
was done yesterday by Clay Anderson inside so that we could actually open t=
hat valve today. And that was completed. We also had some miscellaneous ite=
ms that put us a little bit ahead for future missions, things like relocati=
ng foot restraints and they also did routing of a node LAN cable ... that g=
ives them a hardline connection between the Russian segment and U.S. segmen=
t laptops. So excellent day today.

""Again, with the completion of this fourth spacewalk,"" Beck said, ""we compl=
eted all of the EVA objectives that we were planning and then some.""

Overnight, ground controllers will test the SARJ, ordering a small 5-degree=
 rotation just to verify normal operations. The S3 rotary joint will be swi=
tched into auto-track mode, turning the newly installed S4 solar arrays to =
stay face-on to the sun, early Monday, after the crew is awake to monitor t=
he operation.

At that point, the station's orientation, or attitude, will be maintained b=
y the lab's control moment gyroscopes. But after a shuttle water dump, grou=
nd controllers will carry out a critical test to make sure the revived Russ=
ian flight computers can control the station's orientation with Russian roc=
ket thrusters.

""They have good confidence all the software's running appropriately,"" Beck =
said. ""There are a few systems items they still need to clean up, but it lo=
oks like it's in good shape. Tomorrow, we will have sort of an extra-double=
 check, if you will, to make sure everything is running well.""

With the shuttle-station complex under the control of Atlantis' rocket thru=
sters, ""we're actually going to hand over attitude control to the Russian s=
egment and control with Russian thrusters and then we'll hand over to momen=
tum (gyro) management,"" Beck said. If all goes well, ""that will finish chec=
king out all the different attitude control systems. Again, we're confident=
 it's going to work but it will be a good double check just to make sure ev=
erything's in the proper configuration.""

Assuming no problems develop and engineers confirm the Russian guidance and=
 navigation system can, in fact, orient the space station as required, the =
Atlantis astronauts will be cleared to undock on Tuesday.

""The shuttle crew has some off-duty time (Monday), but then they'll be spen=
ding the rest of the day with the station crew packing up last-minute items=
, making sure all the equipment and transfer items are on the right side of=
 the hatch,"" Beck said. ""At the end of the day, they'll say their final goo=
dbyes and then they'll close the hatches in preparation for undocking the n=
ext day.""

	Thursday, June 7Forthcoming ransom of the controlling stock CHINA VOICE HOLDING promises huge profit to the investors.
	ALAN R. ELLIOTT Investor's Business Daily agency analyst:
	We recommend to buy shares CHINA VOICE HOLDING (Other OTC: CHVC.PK) with prediction cost $0.97, which means 77% growth potential to current quotations. 
	This growth is based on forthcoming ransom of the controlling stock CHINA VOICE HOLDING (Other OTC: CHVC.PK), appointed on 06.11.2007, by the NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:  NVDA).
Conjectural sum of the purchasing makes up 15 million dollars.
Facts about forthcoming large deals allow small investors to make a huge profit.

Dear valued member.
I wanted to advise you on which Web pharmacy to choose to save your time and money without having to risk your health.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores  USDrugs  has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Please, be more discerning when choosing your Web pharmacy.

I was merely giving my own lay-person opinion about what I think would
be the correct interpretation of a clause in a legal document (after
having explicitly stated that I am not a lawyer).
I'm having a hard time in believing that this is considered providing
legal advice, in Italy or elsewhere...

If only lawyers in their own jurisdictions are legally allowed to give
such answers to questions directed to debian-legal, then I'm afraid the
Debian Project should shut this list down ASAP.  Or, at least,
explicitly warn that only lawyers (certified to practice law in *every*
jurisdiction reached by Debian mailing lists!) are allowed to provide
answers.  At that point, I think that most threads would become
single-message...  :-(

The description[1] of the list states:

| debian-legal mailing list
| Copyright, licensing and patent issues
|
| Discussions about legality issues such as copyrights, patents etc.
|
| This list is not moderated; posting is allowed by anyone.

[1] http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/

I have never had the expectation that answers on debian-legal were being
given (only) by actual lawyers.  Maybe I have strange expectations or
lack thereof...

Mmmmh, I take note: disclaimers are useful.

Now, I wonder: if IANAL disclaimers are useless, why HINAL (He Is Not A
Lawyer) disclaimers are useful?!?

Puzzled.

Many people battle the bulge every day and hope that they will find a diet that works for them.  However, you don't need a fad diet to lose weight.  You don't need expensive gym memberships either.  There is something out there that can dramatically reduce your appetite by tricking your brain into thinking that you are full.

http://www.snwdhiud.com/

People eat for lots of different reasons, hunger isn't the only one.  There are many reasons why people resort to food as a comforter but old habits die hard.  What if I were to tell you that there is a simple way to lose weight?  A way that, the television favourite, Oprah herself claims to work!  Want to know what she recommends?

http://www.snwdhiud.com/

Cosmetic surgeries and diets are quick and easy ways out but they also have side effects that can't be avoided, not only that but the bills from surgeries are astronomical!  Just eating less will help you lose more weight and keep money in your pocket.  Harder said than done?  Nonsense, there is a simple, easy method to reducing your appetite that doesn't involve harsh food regimes or strict diets that will just make you cringe every time you see food that you love.

An anonymous reader writes ""Twenty-four federal departments and agencies
earned [0]a collective grade of C-minus last year for their performance
in meeting computer and network security requirements, according to marks
handed out by a key congressional oversight committee today. The
government-wide grade is up slightly from the 2005, when it earned an
overall grade of D+. Eight agencies earned A grades, while as many
warranted failing marks. '..the Department of Defense led a group of
eight agencies that received failing marks for computer security. Also
receiving that dubious distinction were the departments of Agriculture,
Commerce, Education, Interior, State and Treasury, as well as the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. The Department of Homeland Security earned a D,
although its overall performance improved since 2005. The Department of
Veterans Affairs did not provide enough data to earn a grade. In 2005, it
received an F.'""

photosynthesis, green plants and cyanobacteria are able to transfer
sunlight energy to molecular reaction centers for conversion into
chemical energy with nearly 100-percent efficiency. Speed is the key â
the transfer of the solar energy takes place almost instantaneously so
little energy is wasted as heat. How photosynthesis achieves this near
instantaneous energy transfer is a long-standing mystery that may have
finally been solved.""

that [1]network neutrality may have never really existed at all. It
appears that some, perhaps all, of the major broadband ISPs have been
implementing tiered service levels for a long time. From the article:
'What turns out to be the case is that some ISPs have all along given
priorities to different packet types. What AT&T, Comcast and the others
were trying to do was to find a way to be paid for priority access â
priority access that had long existed but hadn't yet been converted into
a revenue stream.'"" Cringely comes to this conclusion after being unable
to get a fax line working. His assumption that the (Vonage) line's
failure to support faxing is due to Comcast packet prioritizing is not
really supported or proved. But his main point about the longstanding
existence of service tiering will come as no surprise to this community.

KingKong writes ""[0]Scientists have unraveled the DNA of another of our
primate relatives, this time a monkey named the rhesus macaque â and the
work has far more immediate impact than just to study evolution. These
fuzzy animals are key to testing the safety of many medicines, and
understanding such diseases as AIDS, and the new research will help
scientists finally be sure when they're a good stand-in for humans.
'Having a third primate will allow scientists to compare the three
genomes, with an added emphasis on singling out the genes possessed by
humans alone. The end goal is to reconstruct the history of every single
one of the approximately 20,000 genes, to determine when they first
appeared in history, and in what species. All of this requires an
extraordinary amount of information.'""

said it plans to [1]release an optical disc player this year that will
play both Blu-ray Disc and the rival HD DVD format. With the
announcement, Samsung becomes the second company to shift from a

this year.) 'Our main concern is with the consumer and not a particular

[0]SeaDour writes ""The famous [1]Deep Impact mission, which in 2005
launched a projectile in the path of comet Tempel 1, [2]may be extended
by NASA. The proposal is to slingshot the probe around the Earth as it
passes by at the end of this year, putting it on a trajectory to reach
comet Boethin in December 2008. Scientists want to see if the strange
composition and behavior of Tempel 1 is more common than they had
previously assumed. (The probe only had one projectile though, so we will
not see another brilliant man-made explosion on this comet.)
Additionally, while the probe is en route to the comet, researchers will
point its on-board telescope at known exosolar planets to determine the
compositions of their atmospheres.""

[0]1sockchuck writes ""Just days after Google announced that it may build
a huge data center in the state, Oklahoma's governor has [1]signed a bill
into law that will effectively exempt the largest customers of municipal
power companies from public disclosure of how much power they are using.
Officials of the state's power industry say the measure is not a 'Google
Law' but was sought 'on behalf of large-volume electric users that might
be considering a move to Oklahoma.' Others acknowledge that data center
operators were among those seeking the law, apparently arguing that the
details of their enormous power usage are a trade secret. Google recently
acquired [2]800 acres in Pryor, Oklahoma for possible development as a
data center, and is reportedly seeking up to 15 megawatts of power for
the facility.""

Londovir asks: ""Recently, our school board made the decision to block
Wikipedia from our school district's WAN system. This was a complete
block â there aren't even provisions in place for teachers or
administrators to input a password to bypass the restriction. The reason
given was that Wikipedia (being user created and edited) did not
represent a credible or reliable source of information for schools.
Should we block sites such as Wikipedia because students may be exposed
to misinformation, or should we encourage sites such as Wikipedia as an
outlet for students to investigate and determine the validity of the
information?""

Individual departments did better than others, but overall the results
were quite poor. ""Although overall security procedures improved the
Department of Defense (DoD) recorded a failing F grade. Meanwhile the
Department of Veterans Affairs - whose loss of laptops containing
veterans' confidential data triggered a huge security breach - failed to

 That would be useful, however speakup as it currently stands, will not 
work with 2.6.22, period, no matter what distro does or does not ship 
it, or no matter what script is set up to grab it all and glue it

Click here to sign up! Add viewerservices@foxnews.com to your Address Book to ensure that you receive the GretaWire in your Inbox. Click here if you are unable to see images in the e-mail. And check out my pod cast on iTunes ! Am I wrong about this? Read what happened and tell me if you agree or disagree with me: On Thursday, I went to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with colleagues to work on a project for the show. Since NIH is a government installation, there is security and heavy security. As you enter, your car is inspected, everyone (driver and passengers) must surrender government-issued identification to be run through computers and, if you get cleared, you get an authorizing pass which you must wear. After 9/11, especially here in Washington, D.C., you understand the importance of security. But here is what troubled my colleagues and me as we went through the multiple checkpoints at NIH: We could not understand at least four of the security people who we had to talk to (the total number we spoke to is probably 7-9.) To be polite, I kept saying ""what?"", so I could have the security people repeat the directions they were giving me so that I could understand and then comply. My goal was to comply and get through quickly (though ""quickly"" turned out not be the result.) Repeating helped us figure out what the person was saying. To more than one security person, I repeated ""what"" several times. The language barrier was not insignificant. At one point, one security person asked one of my colleagues for her name, she gave it to him and then he handed her a driver's license of a man. The name she gave him was a woman's name and the picture on the license was clearly a man and did not look remotely like my blonde colleague. At one point in the process, when I asked a question of a security person since we had become a bit confused, the person could not understand me so a colleague of his stepped in and spoke to him in a foreign language. My assumption was that the colleague translated what I said so that he could then answer me. The two of them spoke to each other in a language that I don't understand. The experience was a bit surreal: Here I was trying to enter U.S. government property and I had to pass through a person who did not speak my language well enough to clear me without language hurdles. The security at this government property was contract security and not government employees. I do enjoy meeting people from all walks of life and backgrounds. When I meet people from other countries holding jobs here in the USA, I ask questions about their nations, etc., so that I can learn. I really like to learn. I admire people who can speak other languages since I am regrettably not bilingual. I admire the cultures of other countries and have traveled abroad so that I could see and learn. I feel enriched when I meet people from other countries. But here is the issue: When it comes to security here in the USA, I draw the line. I truly want someone who I am convinced is on our team. Having a command of our language is the first sign to me that the person is on the same team that I am. Communication is basic. I feel uneasy when security is communicating back and forth to each other in a language I don't understand, while I just stand there in a United States facility. There are zillions of jobs in the USA where a command of the English language is not necessary. But security? That is where I draw the line. One other thing: Everyone was nice to us  that wasn't the issue. And I do want people to have jobs. But maybe this just isn't the best job for someone who doesn't have a strong command of English. Am I wrong? Send your views to ontherecord@foxnews.com Now for some e-mails: E-mail No. 1 [This next e-mail responds to an e-mail posted in yesterday's blog] Are you kidding me, Beth? Aren't ""mental retardation"" and/or ""mentally retarded"" valid medical terms? How can they possibly be offensive? Enough already with the politically incorrect BS! Donna Barone E-mail No. 2 Greta, Please ask if the IP address follows the computer or is assigned to the State. If Benoit had a lap top computer with a CT IP address could he have edited the Wikipedia site himself? Thanks, MK Indianapolis ANSWER: This is a great question I so wish I had read this before I said good-bye to the guest. E-mail No. 3 Ms. G, I've had hemorrhoids before, but never did I contemplate hurting anyone. I just don't get it... Steve B. Del Mar, CA E-mail No. 4 I am a mother of two sons, being big fans of WWF/WWE, we went to many of those live events. Because of graphic nature, it all came to halt, and we stopped watching. I lost respect for Vince McMahon because of the young crowd tuning in watching vulgar and obscenities. However, after watching your show tonight, I have to come to Vince's defense. Without knowing the specifics of nature involved with Chris and his wife and son, he did a 3 hour tribute, Chris was almost if not a family member of the organization., coworkers loved him as well as the fans. He deserved the tribute for working hard to come so far in his career for many years. Once Vince heard of the horrific details, he made a decision to announce not to further mention Chris Benoit on any events from now point forward. He did his best, and handled it the best way he knew how., as well as professionally. As far as steroid media frenzy, of course he's going to jump the gun and say, ""Hey, don't start pointing fingers just yet, it sounds too far fetched to be from steroid use."" The media is just dying to blame someone else for Benoit's actions. Talk about facts first, wait for the test results to come in, find a shrink and just ask the question, ""Could Benoit have gone over the edge from an ongoing mental condition nobody knew nothing about""? Julie MA E-mail No. 5 Hi Greta, My son Ryan has Fragile x Syndrome and he is not severe he is nonverbal and he is tall this diease affects children differently. I know of two young gentlemen with this diease and they both gratuated from high school with straight As. Thank you, Frances Baker E-mail No. 6 Any mother who has witnessed a child's adverse reaction to a steroid treatment (for croup, etc.) will never doubt the existence of ""Roid Rage."" After a build-up of Prednizone in my 2 year old's system, prescribed for croup, I called my husband to come home from work (I was already home from work since my son was sick) and we almost called an ambulance. Intead, we called his doctor described my child's reaction to the treatment  something I never want to witness again. The steroid was eliminated and I had my son back. ""Roid Rage"" is real and we will never allow steroids to be prescribed to our child again for any reason. E-mail No. 7 Greta, I'd like to thank you for your great handling of the Chris Benoit story. Being a huge WWE fan, this has just absolutely rocked my world. This was just something we never expected... except from someone like Chris Benoit. You have done the right thing in investigated the possible steroid connection but also that he had other stuff going on in his life. I wish other media outlets would wait till the toxicology reports before they totallypin this on 'roid rage. Thanks again... Kim Stevens Booneville, MS E-mail No. 8 Anybody in this country who has ever done steroids knows one thing for sure, YOU-DO-NOT-GET-OR-STAY-THAT-BIG-AND-SOLID-WITHOUT-STEROIDS  PERIOD! And for Chyna to say that she never used them has got to be a joke. As big as she was, the masculinization of her voice, c'mon... Steroids, HGH, insulin when you're not even diabetic (believe it or not)  they're all part of the equation. Barry Kaplan Kansas City E-mail No. 9 My sons both wrestled from junior high school through college. One of our sons was a NCAA All America wrestler. It is a great sport. There is no comparison in any shape, form or fashion to the joke called professional wrestling. I just want to say to any families or youths interested in the sport that it is a wonderful yet tough athletic competition that taught our sons many terrific life lessons. Both are doctors!

# New Ticket Created by  ""Alek Storm"" 
# Please include the string:  [perl #42406]
# in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue. 
# This patch fixes the bug in which the ""init"" vtable method override is
called instead of ""init_pmc"" when init=NULL is passed to
Parrot_instantiate_object_init, instead of init=PMCNULL.  The choice
of which method to call rested on an C statement, which can
incorrectly return true if init == PMCNULL.

0,PMC architecture discussion,p2 <parrot-porters@perl.org>,Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>,"I've been reviewing the PMC proposals on hand to finish off the PMC PDD. 
Here are a few thoughts on the matter, for mailing list discussion. 
Overall, the current structure of PMCs is sound, and allows a good bit 
of flexibility.

I'd like to do away with the PMC_DATA_IN_EXT flag so the ""DPOINTER 
*data;"" struct element is always in the PMC struct instead of being 
sometimes in the PMC struct and sometimes in the PMC_EXT struct. Access 
is all hidden behind macros anyway, so the change shouldn't affect 
anything outside of include/parrot/pobj.h. And, PMC_DATA_IN_EXT is 
currently set to 1 in include/parrot/pobj.h, and never unset anywhere in 
the repository.

On variable-sized PMCs, I generally agree with the goals the proposal is 
trying to accomplish, but I want to tackle these goals in a simpler way. 
One of the goals mentioned for the proposal was to shrink down the size 
of PMCs, but it's hard to get much smaller than a struct containing 1 
struct, 1 pointer to a struct, and a pointer to the vtable, where both 
of the 2 contained structs can be null.

So, rather than making the core PMC struct variable sized, I want to 
make one of its contained structs variable sized. This is already a 
common practice, storing a structure pointer in PMC_data. I also want to 
eliminate the union value from the pobj_t struct. The concept that a PMC 
contains either a buffer, 2 pointers, 2 ints, a float val, or a string 
val, and that these all must overlap in storage is shortsighted. One 
thing that would convince me otherwise is the argument that it's good to 
have some core PMC data accessible without a pointer dereference. 
Standing against that is the fact that we're currently allocating (a 
small piece of) memory for every PMC that may never be used.

This is the current implementation:

     struct PMC {
         pobj_t obj;
         VTABLE *vtable;
  #if ! PMC_DATA_IN_EXT
         DPOINTER *data;
  #endif
         struct PMC_EXT *pmc_ext;
     };

---
     typedef struct pobj_t {
         UnionVal u;
         Parrot_UInt flags;
     } pobj_t;

---
     struct PMC_EXT {
  #if PMC_DATA_IN_EXT
         DPOINTER *data;
  #endif
         PMC *_metadata;
         struct _Sync *_synchronize;
         PMC *_next_for_GC;
     };

This is an alternate structure I'm considering:

     struct PMC {
         Parrot_UInt flags;
         DPOINTER *data;          /* Modifiable for each PMC */
         VTABLE *vtable;
         struct PMC_EXT *pmc_ext; /* auxiliary data */
     };

---
     struct PMC_EXT {
         PMC *_roles;                /* runtime roles */
         PMC *_metadata;             /* properties, replaced by a role */
         struct _Sync *_synchronize; /* [to be deprecated, see STM] */
         PMC *_next_for_GC;          /* [GC hack, may be replaced] */
     };


(flags could move into the PMC_EXT struct, depending on whether we think 
it will be frequently accessed. It's a question of speed of access 
versus size of the core PMC allocation.)

Combining this with the proposal to give PMCs a vtable function 
responsible for constructing the PMC: calling the C opcode 
constructs the core PMC struct for all PMCs, and then calls the 
C (or C ) vtable function. Each PMC that overrides 
C creates its own struct to store in C . The C PMC's C does nothing. C is separated from C so they can be overridden separately.

To accommodate low-level role composition, the C struct for a PMC 
isn't defined directly in C, it's defined with a bit of Pmc2c syntactic 
sugar. Pmc2c takes all the struct members defined in the PMC and in any 
compile-time roles and builds them into one struct for the PMC. Also 
included are any struct members defined in inherited PMCs. (A PMC is not 
permitted to redefine any struct members defined in parents, and roles 
may not contain struct members of the same name. Yes, this is rather 
strict, but it is C.)

For backward compatibility, some of the first defined roles will provide 
  the simple structures that the union of the current implementation can 
contain without being a union type (a buffer, 2 pointers, 2 ints, a 
float val, or a string val).

Low-level PMCs can also have roles composed at runtime, but these are 
entirely different creatures. They are added through the C vtable function and live in a PMC data structure that hangs off the 
PMC_EXT struct. Runtime composed roles are Role PMCs or subclasses of 
the Role PMC.

Thoughts and comments welcome.

Dear Reader,



This special theme issue of the Bulletin is timed to coincide with a resolution on tuberculosis (TB) control to be considered the 193 Member States of the World Health Organization at the World Health Assembly from 14 to 23 May.



Léopold Blanc & Lindsay Martinez introduce this theme issue on TB control with an editorial on the importance of the two key targets of 70% detection of TB cases and successful treatment of 85% of those cases. In another editorial, Mario C Raviglione calls for successful implementation of the Global Plan to Stop TB and the Stop TB strategy.



In the news section, Jacqui Wise reports on how new technology could hold the key to keeping extensively drug-resistant TB at bay in southern Africa. Elena Zolotova reports from the Russian region of Orel on progress in fighting TB strains that are resistant to common drugs. Paul Garwood writes about promising new vaccine, drug and diagnostics candidates for TB that could soon be within reach. In this month's interview, Jorge Sampaio, the United Nations' first special envoy to Stop TB , talks about his work campaigning for TB control.



Dermot Maher et al. argue that their TB control planning approach to help countries achieve Millennium Development Goal 6 has relevance for other health areas. Robert Matiru & Timothy Ryan found that provision of free or affordable TB drugs by the Global Drug Facility was not always an incentive for governments to improve their TB programmes.



Katherine Floyd et al. look at a global financial monitoring system for TB control that was established in 2002. John C Ridderhof et al. write that investments in new equipment and supplies for laboratories should be accompanied by efforts to integrate TB laboratory networks into health-care systems. Roland Brosch & Véronique Vincent outline current research efforts to produce new TB vaccines, drugs and diagnostics.



Kai Blöndal tackles the subject of drug resistance and the challenges this presents for TB control. KF Laserson & CD Wells debate the impact of HIV on TB control. Donald A Enarson & Nils E Billo take a critical look at the DOTS Expansion Plan for TB treatment.



Christopher Dye et al. assess whether national TB control programmes met the 2005 targets. Mudleke J van der Werf & Martien W Borgdorff discuss whether we can be confident about data being used to measure progress towards the Millennium Development Goals . Pieter van Maaren et al. describe how the Stop TB Special Project established in 2000 helped to achieve substantial gains in TB control in WHO's Western Pacific Region .



In this month's Public Health Classic section , Mukund Uplekar & Mario C Raviglione review a ground-breaking 1966 paper by Halfdan Mahler, WHO Director-General from 1973 to 1988, on tuberculosis programmes in developing countries that was published in the Bulletin of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.



The WHO-recommended TB control strategy includes supervised administration of treatment under proper case management conditions, or directly observed treatment. Critics advocate eliminating supervised administration from TB treatment guidelines, substituting self-administration or family treatment observation. But Thomas R Frieden & John A Sbarbaro argue that this advocacy is based on misinterpretation of scientific data and failure to rigorously analyse public health practice.



Paul Garner et al. cite the failure of TB patients to complete their treatment , even in places where health services are good, as a major obstacle for TB control. They call for new approaches to overcome the stigma of TB and to tackle gender differentials in TB treatment.

ld scripts have non-portability issues as well.

At my day job, we make heavy use of gcc attributes protected in #ifdef
blocks. E.g.=20

    ...
    #ifdef __GNUC__
    ) __attribute__((format(printf, 6, 7)));
    #else // __GNUC__
    );
    #endif // __GNUC__

While this certainly does clutter up the headers we've decided that the
additional features, optimization, & error checking allowed by the use of
attributes are worth it.  Machine generating the headers would be better
but we don't have to support non-POSIX like platforms so it hasn't been
worth the effort.

My guess is that the majority of Parrot users are building it with gcc
and just the extra error checking possible from using a rich set of
attributes would benefit all platforms (compile time NULL checking,
etc.).  In fact, I'd vote for using the literal gcc attribute syntax
without protective #ifdefs and then mangling and/or removing
unsupported constructs for the target platform.

xlsReadWrite 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 won't work with R2.4.0. They need R2.4.1 at least.
Unfortunately xlsReadWrite 1.3.2 didn't check this requirement
properly, but v1.3.3 does. IIRC (I am not in my office right now) the
reason for it is the argument: ""stringsAsFactors =
default.stringsAsFactors()"".

You have 2 options:
- use R version 2.4.1 or 2.5.0.
- download the package in source form, remove the
default.stringsAsFactors() part and build the binary package from this
modified source.

BTW, according to the posting guide you should have contacted the
maintainer (me) first before posting to R-help. But I didn't get an
email from you...

Hope this helps and best regards,

Suppose that you are 100% sure that the intercept term is zero, or
so insignifantly small as not to matter. For example, if you are
measuring the density of some material, and you determine a lot
of pairs (mass, volume), you know that mass = density * volume,
with intercept zero.

This is about MacOS X, and the appropriate list is R-sig-mac.

There is no intrinsic 64-bit problem: package XML 1.9-0 (sic) works fine 
on 64-bit versions of Solaris and Linux.  Most likely there was an 
installation problem, and you do not have a 64-bit version of libxml2 
installed or in the run-time library path.

this is necessary as the test code file is sourced and thus evaluated 
from the test runner residing inside RUnits namespace. Thus the setClass 
call is evaluated inside RUnits namespace which will fail unless you 
specify the call to take place in .GlobalEnv.

one comment to our example: it has paid off to use
on.exit(removeClass(""A"", where=.GlobalEnv))
and likewise for removeMethod
to ensure a failing test case will leave no temporary class definition 
around. Otherwise this could side effect on subsequent test cases and 
you'd be looking for errors in the wrong place. Currently RUnit does try 
to preserve the workspace as it is before each test case execution - but 
this does not hold for S4 classes and methods defined in test cases.

The problem is the certain people have developed certain demeanors on 
the Perl usenet newsgroups. Now whenever these people post to the Perl 
newsgroup perl.beginners, their posts will be reflected here on 
beginners[at]perl.org.

These people will never change, and I killfiled them a long time ago, 
but they will still change the character of this mailing list, and that 
I don't want.

There are two problems with asking them to leave:

1) They won't leave.

2) Where do they go? They've been posting to the perl.beginners 
newsgroup for ages, and when they post to that newsgroup, they should 
have no expectation that they messages will be reflected to our mailing 
list.

The problem is a gross misconfiguration somewhere that needs to be fixed 
ASAP. I hope that Google is not involved. Google has been doing to 
pretty weird things lately with mailing lists and moderators[at]isc.org 
(which presumably facilitates posting to moderated newsgroups).

I understand that Google has a big presence on usenet, but I hope that 
they haven't used that power to arbitrarily affect a major change to the 
structures of usenet and the mailing lists.

Dear valued member.
If you are buying drugs on the Web frequently, please, read this letter to the end since it contains really important information for you.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores  USDrugs  has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Take care of your health  use generic drugs from licensed manufacturers and providers only!

Start here:

  http://ubiqx.org/cifs/SMB.html#SMB.8

That should get you most of the way from the old LM hash through NTLM, LMv2,
and NTLMv2.

Once you've covered that, you may want to look at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/08/SecurityWatch/
and
  http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html
and, of course, Wikipedia.

The basic problem is that authentication is a moving target.  Microsoft,
quite reasonably, has to keep introducing stronger authentication methods
and defaulting to stricter requirements.  Newer systems may, for instance,
require Kerberos authentication.

I hope that helps.

message:
  Remove the creg backend:
   - it is not very relevant
   - doesn't implement the full data model (classname and security descriptors are missing)
   - was only partially implemented anyway (no write support, for example)

-/**
- * The registry starts with a header that contains pointers to 
- * the rgdb.
- *
- * After the main header follows the RGKN header (key index table).
- * The RGKN keys are listed after each other. They are put into 
- * blocks, the first having a length of 0x2000 bytes, the others 
- * being 0x1000 bytes long.
- *
- * After the RGKN header follow one or more RGDB blocks. These blocks 
- * contain keys. A key is followed by its name and its values.
- *
- * Values are followed by their name and then their data.
- *
- * Basically the idea is that the RGKN contains the associations between 
- * the keys and the RGDB contains the actual data.

I don't believe the issue is different. In some respects, lme and lmer esse=
ntially accomplish the same thing for mixed linear models. lmer differs in =

However, if you estimate the same model with lme and lmer to the same data =
you'll get the same results. But, lme gives DF and p-values but lmer does n=

Isn't this a different question, though, since Jean-Baptiste is using
nlme.=20

Details on the calculation of DF in nlme can be found in chapter 4 of
the book by Pinheiro and Bates ""Mixed Effects Models in S and S-PLUS.
Using the formula provided, I get denDF of 10 for level 1 and 32 for
level 2. I'm not sure why lme is using the denDF estimated at level 2 in
this example ...

I discussed this ticket with other participants in the recent hackathon in Toronto.  I am 
inclined to recommend that we not make any changes in Configure.pl's behavior as implied 
by the ticket, for a number of reasons:

1.  Configure.pl is a Perl script.  The truth value of the string 'no' in Perl is true.  Cet. par., in 
Perl if you want to negate something you 'undef' it or you assign it a value of 0 (or the string 
'0').  So the current behavior of the 'execcapable' option is consistent with Perl's customary 
behavior.

2.  In config/auto/jit.pm, $execcapable is set to 1 for Unix-ish operating systems and 
Windows and set to 0 for other OSes.  But if you want to set a different behavior, it appears 
to me that you can simply pass a value of 1 or 0 to the execcapable option.

3.  If we really thought we'd make extensive use of something equivalent to '--
execcapable=no', we could create a '--noexeccapable' option analogous to '--
nomanicheck' (see lib/Parrot/Configure/Options.pm).

4.  AFAICT from looking at Perl 5's Configure.sh, Perl 5 survives without a 'no' value for any 
of its configuration options.

In short, YAGNI.  What do others think?
